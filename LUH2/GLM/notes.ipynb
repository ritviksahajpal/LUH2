    "* wood clearing for agriculture: for each grid-cell this is the sum of transitions from primary to cropland and pasture, multiplied by the cell area and the potential biomass density PLUS the sum of transitions from secondary to cropland and pasture, multiplied by the cell area and secondary mean biomass density. To get a global total, sum this over all grid-cells.\n",
    "* clearing rate for shifting cultivation: for our previous approach this was 1/15*(cropland + pasture)*SC_mask* cell area. For our new approach we will not include pasture and we will change the 1/15 to 1 and use the Andreas map instead of the previous SC_mask.\n",

    "The less easy ones are:\n",
    "* Percentage of secondary land generated by wood harvest and shrinking cultivation\n",
    "* Area of forested land in shifting cultivation fallow  (2000)\n",
    "The reason that these are more difficult is because there is currently no easy way to isolate the effects of shifting cultivation from the effects of other agricultural activity. So, in the past what I have done is run one simulation with shifting cultivation turned on, and another with it turned off and compare the differences in secondary land area, and for fallow the secondary land area within the SC area on forested land. Now that our simulations are taking much longer to run it is not convenient to run multiple simulations to get these diagnostics though. In addition over the last few months I have often wondered about the impacts of SC and have had trouble isolating them from other processes. So, for a while now I have been thinking that we should output the SC transitions separately from the other transitions, just for our own diagnostic purposes. What I would propose is generating a 4th netCDF file (diagnostics.nc) and include SC transitions and other variables that are useful for our diagnostics. We would need to modify the outputter and also add some variables to the states/flows to track SC transitions and areas etc."
